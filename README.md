# Chat App

Started with the intentions of trying out both angular2+ (Was only familiar with AngularJS till this point) and using Firebase realtime for realtime purpose instead of just storage.

Was originally thinking that there would be api requirements, so started the project on Express, and created the angular project inside the public folder, intending to wire some CI to build the code in public folder for deploy.

Started with an angular default app, and created google login integration for getting different users. Then added a text box to start work on the internals.

Ended up connecting it to firebase and able to print anytime a text is received or sent in the same channel that the user is on right now.

And then like most projects, ended up abandoning it at this point. Went on to play with react projects instead of angular at this point.
